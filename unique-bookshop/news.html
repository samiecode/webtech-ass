				Who can get enough of bookish newsletters? Not me. I have
				subscribed to many newsletters over the years, (and unsubscribed
				to many as well). But there are some that are close to heart,
				that always put a smile on my face when I see the darkened
				‘unread’ in my inbox. Here they are — the best literary
				newsletters to subscribe to. Also, the good news is that they
				are all free.
			</p>

			<p>
				This list is divided into three — literary newsletters that
				focus on book recommendations, poetry newsletters for your poem
				fix and literary newsletters that present curated literary think
				pieces and essays. When I started compiling this list, I
				promised myself to limit the list to 15. Secondly, I wanted to
				showcase bookish and literary newsletters written by one (or
				two) people (who I assume would read a couple of books, then sit
				down to write all about them), not newsletters sent by bigger
				publications compiled by many staff members. But as I was
				listing the names, I thought if you are looking for a good books
				newsletter to subscribe to, chances are you might also love to
				have something on the side — maybe an essay, an interview, a
				memoir or a reading list. Hence the last section on literary
				newsletters include literary newsletters from bigger publishing
				names. I have taken care to list those that are collaborations
				and those that feature good writing from other websites instead
				of those newsletters that are a marketing extension of the posts
				published on their own platform. For more books stuff (and
				newsletters), there are amazing, famous websites and
				publications like Millions, The Rumpus, Buzzfeed Books, Book
				Riot, The Paris Weekly, The NYT Books, The Guardian Bookmarks
				etc which have not been included in this list. Maybe another
				list for another day.
				<br />

				For now, here are ten best literary newsletters to subscribe
				right now.
				<br />

				To make things easier for you, I have included snippets to older
				editions of the newsletters — just follow the links and you can
				get a taste. Hopefully this should make it easier for you to
				decide if you’ll love subscribing to them. I find all of them
				fabulous additions to the inbox.

			<p>
				These newsletters focus on book and short story recommendations.
				Each recommendation is personal (yeey!what’s not to love), and
				you’ll often find more books that are similar to the one being
				recommended. I love how each of these literary newsletters take
				an effort to describe their reading experience effectively.
				Always helps me decide whether a book mentioned is for me or
				not.
